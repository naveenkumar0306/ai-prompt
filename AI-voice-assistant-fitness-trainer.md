**User:** How do I do Romanian Deadlifts properly?  
**AI:**  
Sure! Romanian Deadlifts target your hamstrings and glutes.  
1. Stand with feet hip-width apart, holding dumbbells in front of you.  
2. Keep a slight bend in your knees and hinge at your hips, lowering the weights down your legs.  
3. Maintain a flat back and push your hips back.  
4. Stop when you feel a stretch in your hamstrings, then return to the start by driving through your hips.  
Go slow and controlled. Want me to track your reps?
